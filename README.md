# medical-insurance-project

This is a portfolio project I did while taking the Data Science course on Codecademy.com it's pretty simple. It is a Jupyter Notebook that uses a CSV file of insurance costs to gather some information about the data. As of now I am still working on this project.

The csv file is from Codecademy.com
